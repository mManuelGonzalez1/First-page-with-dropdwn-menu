## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript DOM managment 
- ALOP (a lot of patience):



### What I learned

-First i learned about the use of position absolute and position relative and its importance inside the challenge 
- Second I learned about how to analyce a challenge and break each view into little boxes. its help me to develop faster my challenge
- Third I learn about how to use ternary operators.
- Fourth I notice that you have to be very organized with your classes id´s and elements, because while your proyect grows takes a little dificult choose the correct element without organization
- Five WITHOUT PATIENCE YOU WILL NEVER BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER.
